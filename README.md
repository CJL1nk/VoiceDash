# VoiceDash
A GD Mega Hack extension that allows you to play GD with your voice

wsg

So basically 

- VoiceDash.dll goes in your Mega Hack extensions folder
- portaudio_x86.dll goes in your base GD folder, with GeometryDash.exe

Make sure the mic you want to use is set as the default device, otherwise it wont work.

have fun :)


# ----- ISSUES -----
- If you open the game while in a Discord call the vc audio may cut out, which can be simply fixed by leaving and rejoining the call. Looking into a fix for this.
